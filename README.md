# Basing 25+5 Clock in React on Replit 

25 + 5 Clock, for setting break/session length with sound (beep), when timer turns to 0. Set the timers on 1 minute and try it out!

## You can run this app (or check the code) on https://replit.com/@KarelJek/25-5-Clock-React#src/App.tsx

### Running React on Repl.it

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a blazing fast frontend build tool that includes features like Hot Module Reloading (HMR), optimized builds, and TypeScript support out of the box.

Using the two in conjunction is one of the fastest ways to build a web app.

### Getting Started
- Hit run
- Edit [App.tsx](#src/App.tsx) and watch it live update!

By default, Replit runs the `dev` script, but you can configure it by changing the `run` field in the [configuration file](#.replit). Here are the vite docs for [serving production websites](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html)
